			<div class="minor-section special-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was pretty smooth sailing, as we covered a bit of it last section as well as in class thursday. We did have to be careful to spell correctly and remember to update all the code when we made name changes.</p>
