					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create a funtion that took in the user name from an input window, and print that out, but sorted with the sort() function.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had some problems with the prompt window appearing twice, and with the window loading before the page. We fixed it appearing twice, but couldnt get it to not appear before the page loaded, as we had problems with DEFER not printing our results.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, the lab went pretty smoothly, with a bit of bug fixing, but I think we did pretty well with learning about array methods and functions in general.</p>
