					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To learn how to use javascript in order to print output on our webpage, as well as learn about variables and operations they can perform.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't really any problems, we were able to finish it during section, while in person. We did get curious what the br at the end of each javascript document write was, but figured it out eventually.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went pretty well, I had already had programming experience prior to this, and javascript's syntax wasn't too hard to pick up. It was nice to learn a bit more about other languages. </p>
