			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to organize our file structure and learn to link images to our html file. It also was about formatting the images so that it looked alright on the webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose were the images becoming super big when first importing them into vs code, and would take up the whole website. We figured how to scale the images down, and have them sit nicely on the page. We did have some minor issues with interperting the instructions, but figured it out in the end. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment was pretty chill. It wasn't very challenging for me persnally, as a lot of it was pretty intuitive. I found it fun to try and find a new font to use for the headers when I was messing around with the css for Lab 3. I also gouped all the images for this Lab into the same class so I'd be able to edit them at the same time, which was nice.</p>
