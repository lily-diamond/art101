					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to mess around with the html and css files to customize our website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had to look for why our site background was green, and found the site.css file, which had overall default colors for the site. Then we were able to get the background to be a different color.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well, we were able to experiment with lots of different edits to css, including making the text white. We both came into the project with the idea that it would be very experimental. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">We made our website look more colorful and different from the original one.</div>
