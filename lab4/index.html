				<h2>Code</h2>

//psuedocode for rock paper scissors:
//
//Create a field for player 1 input
	//Accept user input, “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”
//Generate computer choice
//Evaluate who wins 
	//Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper
//Display who wins
//Ask if the player wants to play again, and repeat from step 1 if yes.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Practice pseudocoding and problem solving, to get into the mindset of a programmer.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The commented out code had wierd formatting, so we had to figure out how to indent it properly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went well, we took a while to come up with some tasks to psuedocode. There were some moments we were confused on what the assignment actually wanted from us. But, we got there in the end. </p>
