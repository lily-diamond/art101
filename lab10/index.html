					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a psuedo chat room that we would be able to add to with the click of a button.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose were typical mispelling errors or accidentally making something a class instead of an id.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, after attempting task x, I felt pretty good about the outcome. I wanted to make it look somewhat like windows XP with the colors, border and overall vibe of it.</p>
